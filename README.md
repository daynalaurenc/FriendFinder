## Description
This application gives users access a database of individuals seeking friendship. 

The user opens the Friend Finder app, and chooses to fill out the survey questions. These questions are used in an algorithm to decipher compatability amongst the user and those previously stored in the database.

User input for name and a link to a personal photo is required to have a valid application. Once all fields are met in the Compatability Curator, the user is able to submit. The app will then return a user's name and image who is most compatable.
